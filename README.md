# DevOps_CICD_Jenkins_Docker_Kubernetes_Helm
Some sample work I did with Jenkins CICD pipeline, Docker image and Kubernetes, including an example to implement Semantic Versioning for Swagger docs, Docker image, Kubernetes deployment, and Helm rollback (see Version_Control folder); another example to enable testing scripts to be executed against multiple environments with different credentials in CI/CD pipeline (see Multi_Enviroment folder). Source code has been deleted for privacy reasons, only sample DevOps related files are presented in this repo..

# How to use this repo is mentioned in README.docx in each of the "Version_Control" and "Multi_Environment" folders
